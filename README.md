GEOSOLAR
===================================================================
<b>Power generation</b> with the usage of <i>photovoltaic cells</i> has a quite unstable character and depends on many factors of the environment. 
One of them is a quantity of solar energy that falls on a plane of PV cell.
	The maximal <b>work efficiency</b> of the photovoltaic station is achieved when the inclination angle is calculated properly.
	This application consists an algorithm for definition of the <b>optimal angle of the PV cell</b>. It depends on a geolocation and work period of the solar station.
	
<b>GEOSOLAR</b> is a web app that calculates the most suitable angle of a solar panel for your geolocation.
