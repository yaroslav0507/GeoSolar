GEOSOLAR
===================================================================
Power generation with the usage of photovoltaic cells has a quite unstable character and depends on many factors of the environment. One of them is a quantity of solar energy that falls on a plane of PV cell.
	The maximal work efficiency of the photovoltaic station is achieved when the inclination angle is calculated properly.
	This graduation work consists an algorithm for definition of the optimal angle of the PV cell. It depends on a geolocation and work period of the solar station.
	
<b>GEOSOLAR</b> is a web app that calculates the most suitable angle of a solar panel for your geolocation.


### Start

To start the app open the terminal and clone the repo 

	`git clone https://github.com/yaroslav0507/GeoSolar.git` 
	
enter the app directory `cd path/to/cloned/application` 
install node modules via <b>NPM</b>

  `npm install`
  
run gulp task `gulp watch`
