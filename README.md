GEOSOLAR
===================================================================
Power generation with the usage of <b>photovoltaic cells</b> has a quite unstable character and depends on many factors of the environment. 
One of them is a quantity of solar energy that falls on a plane of PV cell.
	The maximal <b>work efficiency</b> of the photovoltaic station is achieved when the inclination angle is calculated properly.
	This application consists an algorithm for definition of the <b>optimal angle of the PV cell</b>. It depends on a geolocation and work period of the solar station.
	
<b>GEOSOLAR</b> is a web app that calculates the most suitable angle of a solar panel for your geolocation.

To start the app open the terminal and clone the repo 

	`git clone https://github.com/yaroslav0507/GeoSolar.git` 
	
enter the app directory `cd path/to/cloned/application` 
install node modules via <b>NPM</b>

  `npm install`
  
run gulp task `gulp watch`
